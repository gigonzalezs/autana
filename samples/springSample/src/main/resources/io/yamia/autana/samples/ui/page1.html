<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em><strong>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult</strong>&rdquo;</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>With functional programming we are declaring the problem while writing its implementation in the code. All we have to do is take the requirements of the functionality we want to implement and write them. This way, if they ever change or if someone else has to look at our code, it will be very easy to know what they are doing now and, therefore, add the new specifications.</p>
